### LAB-1
##### (1) Implement Two Stacks in a Single Array.
##### (2) Implement n stacks in an Array.
##### (3) Write the code for the Maze problems. Show the input and output in the Graphical Form. Also show the intermediate stages in the output so that the working of the algorithm is clear.
### LAB-2
##### (1)  Write the Program for search a given word in a matrix of letters. The word may match horizontally, vertically , or diagonally. For successful search show the beginning position and ending position in the matrix. Search all existence of the word in the matrix.
##### (2) Implement N queues in a given Array of Size N. Show the values of the Front, Rear , Boundary pointers for each queue in graphical form after very addition and deletion operation.
##### (3) Implement the Queue using only functions of stack i.e. we are given push() and pop() and we have to implement the Add() and Delete() of queue using these functions.
##### (4) Implement the Stack using only functions of queue i.e. we are given addQ() and DeleteQ() and we have to implement the push() and pop() of stack using these functions.
##### (5) Implement the priority Queues using the 2 Dimensional Array. Show all the add and delete operation in graphical form.
